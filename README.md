> In this repository you'll find **Mordor Command Pattern**. This kata is the perfect introduction to make your first pattern design to develop your application. The best goal of this kata is that you will have a wide range of knowledge of the creational design patterns. Feel free to try to complete this kata, to complete this kata you just need to follow the UML Diagram to know how the application is connected and you just have to copy and paste the test cases and develop your software reaching each test case like if they were the user stories. The Command Pattern is a behavioural pattern, and you can check the link to get more information about it.

## Motivation

The motivation to complete this kata was increase my wide knowledge into the design pattern by GoF. I just started to learn about the design patterns and how important they're for your software, to keep a good and clean architecture and make your software Open Close following the SOLID Principles. The detail to keep your software Open Close is something that everybody should keep in mind before jump to code, it will help you to save lots of headaches in the future. I've really enjoyed doing this kata, I've founded really simple and useful and I already can imagine a wide range of functionalities.

## Why choose this pattern ?

In this section I'll enumerate the main reasons that made me choose this Command Behavioural Design Pattern and hopefully you'll understand what it makes this pattern really cool:

1. It's a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category

2. Transform a request of an independent pattern that contains all the information about the request

3. This pattern is based into the principle of divide responsibilities

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

- The classes of the pattern will follow the Single Responsibility Principle

- The application follows the Open Close Principles

-Lets you implement undo/redo operations

- Let you group a series of simple commands to create a complex one

### Disadvantages

- The code can become complex since you are entering a new layer between emitters and receivers

- There are a high number of classes and objects working together to achieve a goal. Application developers need to be careful developing these classes correctly

## Reflections

My opinion about the Command Pattern has been actually really great. I felt really comfortable all the way developing the software following the UML Diagram and the test cases like the user stories I had to reach. I think that the test cases were actually really well planed, and it let to you the chance of go growing your software step by step without miss any of the main points or without understand why you're doing it by the way it has been purposed. You just need go with careful naming the packages and classes because it will grow the amount really fast and make a good naming of the components of your software will make your process much easier.
